General View (For all):
	Map View:
		Have the map take up the whole page with a search bar and a nav tab that opens up on the left side
		Have the ability to login either as an admin or a student
		When searching, make some regex that can separate hall name and room num/floor
		Show the location as a pin and maybe a shape
		* Possibly add a route option
		Location Tab:
			Have the tab open up with an image of it along with a description and links
			If a building, do the following:
				if the user is looking for a room/floor have it have a link that'll open up the floor plan that'll replace the map view.

	Nav Bar:
		Settings View:
			Dark mode
			Location? (maybe ask for it?)
			Cookies (will have to see)
		About:
			A little page about me and this program
	
	Building View:
		When inside the floor plan of a building, have the ability to switch floors and search rooms
		* Possibly add a route option
	
	

Admin View (same as general, just has a FEW differences):
	Map View:
		In the nav tab, have a tools section that'll open up admin tools
		Tool section:
			The following exists (these go into separate views):
				Add Building, Modify Building, Remove Building
	
	Add Location View:
		Allows admins to add a location
		Asks for location name, location shape (allows for straight lines and arcs or rectangle and circle mode for an easier time)
		/ location (where the pin will be), floor plan (optional?), description, if it is in a building (asks for more info after that),
		/ if it is in a building (asks for more after that)

User View (same as general, just has a FEW differences):
	Map View:
		Nav tab:
			Has option to request and favorite locations
	Request Location view:
		Can only request a location, not a building
		Asks for location name, if it is in a building (asks for more after that), location shape (allows for straight lines and arcs or rectangle and circle mode for an easier time)
		/ location (where the pin will be), description, if it is in a building (asks for more info after that),
		If in building, asks which building it is in (maybe have a it auto complete?) and roomnumber (optional)
